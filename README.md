# TP_Similarity

Dataset reference as well as R and python code corresponding to the Viewpoint (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1021/acsestwater.4c00240 )
The dataset used for the analysis can be found here: https://zenodo.org/records/5644561 

Regarding the R script (ChemmineR_similarity.R): the mcs function loop can be quite time consuming, which is why the dataset (similarity_mcsTanimoto.csv) is also attached. Importing this you can jump from line 8 directly to line 34. 
Remember to adjust working directory and file paths!

The python script (TP_similarity.py) also needs further adjustments of the filepath and installation of pandas and rdkit libraries.
